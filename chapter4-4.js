// Is Word Alphabetical
// Nikki, a queen of gentle sarcasm, loves the word facetiously. 
// Lance helpfully points out that it is the only known English word that contains 
// all five vowels in alphabetical order, and it even has a ‘y’ on the end! 
// Nikki takes a break from debugging to turn and give him an acid stare – indeed a 
// look that was delivered arseniously. Given a string, return whether all contained letters are in alphabetical order.

// D Gets Jiggy
// Write a function that accepts as a parameter a string containing someone’s name. 
// Return a string containing the following oh-so-cool greeting: strip off the first letter of the name, 
// capitalize this new word, and add " to the [first letter]!" Given "Dylan", return "Ylan to the D!

// Common Suffix
// Lance is writing his opus: Epitome, an epic tome of beat poetry. 
// Always ready for a good rhyme, he constantly seeks words that end with the same letters. 
// Write a function that, when given a word array, returns the largest suffix (word-end) 
// common to all words in the array. For inputs ["deforestation", "citation", "conviction", "incarceration"], 
// return "tion" (not all that creative a rhyming point). If it is ["nice", "ice", "baby"], return "", 
// because that’s just … not.

// Book Index
// Martin is writing his opus: a book of algorithm challenges, set as lyrics to a suite of a cappella fugues. 
// Some of ‘those fugueing challenges’ are less popular than others, so he needs an index. Given a sorted array of 
// pages where a term appears, produce an index string. Consecutive pages should form ranges separated by a hyphen. 
// For [1,13,14,15,37,38,70], return string "1, 13-15, 37-38, 70". Take care to get all the commas and spaces correct: 
// Martin is palpably particular (practically persnickety!) about patchy punctuation.

// Drop the Mike
// Create a standalone function that accepts an input string, removes leading and trailing white space 
// (at beginning and end only), capitalizes the first letter of every word, and returns that string. 
// If original string contains the word "Mike" anywhere, immediately return "stunned silence" instead.

function dropTheMike(){

// Coin Change with Object
// As before, given a number of U.S. cents, return the optimal configuration of coins, in an object.

// Given an array, return an object containing the array’s max, min and average values.

// Zip Arrays into Map
// Associative arrays are sometimes called maps because a key (string) maps to a value. 
// Given two arrays, create an associative array (map) containing keys of the first, and values of the second. 
// For arr1 = ["abc", 3, "yo"] and arr2 = [42, "wassup", true], return {"abc": 42, 3: "wassup", "yo": true}.

function zipArraysIntoMap(arr1, arr2){

}

// Invert Hash
// Associative arrays are also called hashes (we’ll learn why later). Build invertHash(assocArr) 
// to convert hash keys to values, and values to keys. Example: given {"name": "Zaphod", "charm": "high", "morals": "dicey"}, 
// return object {"Zaphod": "name", "high": "charm", "dicey": "morals"}.

function invertHash(){

}

// Associative Array: Number of Values (without .Length)
// Without using the .length property that is present on all arrays, determine and return 
// the number of values in the given array. If we were to do this on a numerical array, 
// we might check to see whether the element at a certain numerical index was undefined. 
// Unfortunately, we can’t do that here because the keys don’t have any sort of predictable order or first value.
//  
// So, for object { band: "Travis Shredd & the Good Ol’ Homeboys", style: "Country/Metal/Rap", 
// album: "668: The Neighbor of the Beast" }, you should return the value 3, because there are 
// three keys in this object: band, style and album.
